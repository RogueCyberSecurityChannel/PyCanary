PyCanary 
----------------------------

- Create a .txt file with paths to the directories you would like to monitor
- Pass in the path to that .txt file using the -pF command Example: -pF <dir_paths.txt> 
- Wait to see if the files are accessed
- Windows Alert box will pop up if any file in the specified directories are accessed or altered

-Testing stages... bear with me...
